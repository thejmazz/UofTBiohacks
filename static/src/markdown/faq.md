forms. If you don't get a spot right away, we'll put you on the waitlist and
let you know if something opens up!

### How much coding or biology background do I need?

We do not expect an advanced bioinformatics background. However, this hackathon
is not for first time coders. Teams are encouraged to have members with
different backgrounds who work together. Additionally, there will be workshops
provided to improve your bioinformatics skills.  If you lack coding experience make sure
you've got team members who are proficient coders.

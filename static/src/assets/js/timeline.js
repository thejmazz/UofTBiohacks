        Nicholas Provart is a full professor of Plant Cyberinfrastructure and Systems Biology in
        the Department of Cell &amp; Systems Biology at the University of Toronto. Currently his
        Bio-Analytic Resource (BAR) at bar.utoronto.ca, comprising tools for coexpression
        analysis of publicly-available gene expression data, cis-element prediction, identifying
        molecular markers, generating “electronic fluorescent pictographic” (eFP) representations
        of gene expression patterns, and exploring protein-protein interactions in Arabidopsis and
        other plants, is used approximately 60,000 times a month by researchers worldwide. He is
        one of the founding members of the International Arabidopsis Informatics Consortium, is
        president of the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee, and is teaching two
        MOOCs on Bioinformatic Methods on Coursera.org.

      <p>
        Erica Acton entered the field of data science when she needed to 'get stuff done' during her Master's degree
        in Genome Science and Technology at the University of British Columbia. She has subsequently worked as a bioinformatician
        in Vancouver and Toronto, analyzing transcriptome data and visualizing large genomics datasets. She sometimes leaves her
        keyboard to give talks or train others at science education and outreach events that promote data science, or to run
        half-marathons. She is currently at the Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function (CAGEF) where she is
        creating bioinformatics training lessons and workshops, and drinking copious amounts of coffee.

      <p>
        The Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function (CAGEF) promotes interdisciplinary research in
        comparative, evolutionary, and functional analyses of genomes and proteomes, and to promote training and
        education in genome biology through the development and support of innovative teaching initiatives, courses,
        and workshops. CAGEF provides genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatic services, including Illumina-based genome,
        microbiome, and metagenome sequencing and transcriptome analysis, and proteome and protein modification analysis
        via LC-MS/MS. CAGEF has genomics expertise in the analysis of non-standard species, systems, and environments, with
        particular experience in microbial, plant, and environmental genomics and metagenomics.
